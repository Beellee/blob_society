# ðŸ§  BlobSociety Simulation

A Python-based real-time simulation of autonomous agents ("blobs") with randomized traits
that interact, form communities, and exhibit emergent behavior.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```bash
python main.py --num-blobs 50 --grid-size 100
```

## Project Structure
See directory layout in the scaffold.

    __init__.py
    blob.py
  communities/

    community.py
```

## Goals
- Model autonomous agents with diverse traits.
- Allow agents to form and influence communities.
- Visualize simulation in real time.
